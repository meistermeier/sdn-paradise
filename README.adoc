= Spring Data Neo4j Paradise Papers

Exploring the Paradise Papers with Spring Data Neo4j.

NOTE: To provide you an easy access to the data (no modifications and re-mappings needed), I decided to cut down or deactivate some functionality.
Currently this application just allows you to browse the Top10 addresses in the database.
More will come...

== How to get started

The data you will get from ICIJ does not contain any geo information.
The application will try to resolve the address to a location when opening the details of an address.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the Neo4j Desktop matching your OS from https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database
3. Start the Neo4j Desktop (it might take a few seconds more on the first run).
4. Find out on what port Neo4j is available for bolt protocol communication.
The best way to do this is to click the _Manage_ option in the _Offshore Leaks Graph_ tile on the desktop's start screen.
5. Create a google api key with access to the geocode api.
Read more here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start
6. Edit the file `src/main/resources/application.properties` accordingly.
7. Start the application with `mvn spring-boot:run`

=== But I want all the geo data
Oh great, you got an unlimited geocode api access.

== Notes

Thanks to https://github.com/bahar/WorldCityLocations for providing a simple csv file with geo coordinates for a bunch of cities.
